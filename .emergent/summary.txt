The previous AI engineer initiated development by exploring the existing codebase, identifying it as a React frontend with a planned FastAPI backend and MongoDB. After a false start with , the engineer successfully identified core files and installed dependencies, getting the frontend running. A crucial strategic discussion followed, where the user refined product requirements, opting for Gemini API (later DeepSeek) for cost-effectiveness, Razorpay for payments, specific subscription tiers, and a referral program. The engineer prioritized frontend enhancements, successfully implementing advanced forms, subscription UI, referral features, and material/IS code displays. The current state is a fully enhanced frontend. The conversation then shifted to deployment options and pricing updates. The last interaction involved troubleshooting a frontend preview issue and a new explicit request from the user to restart building the frontend and integrate DeepSeek API.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an AI website for floor plan and architecture generation. Key requirements include:
-   **Core Functionality**: Generate floor plans/architecture based on user descriptions.
-   **Compliance**: Adhere to country-specific Indian Standard (IS) codes and architectural ethics.
-   **Estimation**: Provide material and excavation estimations (quantities, not monetary costs).
-   **Technology Stack**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Business Model**:
    -   Subscription model: Free, Pro (initially ₹699/month, updated to ₹999/month), and Enterprise tiers.
    -   Referral program: Credits for active usage by referred users.
-   **AI Integration**: Initially open, user later preferred Gemini API for cost-effectiveness, then specifically requested DeepSeek API.
-   **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay, specifically for its autopay and local Indian market advantages.
-   **Deployment**: User expressed desire to manage database and backend hosting on AWS, GCP, or other cloud providers, seeking deployment guidance.
The application currently features an enhanced frontend with advanced input forms, subscription/referral UIs, and placeholders for material/IS code displays.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Python.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas for managed service).
-   **AI Integration**: Gemini API (initially proposed), DeepSeek API (new user request).
-   **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay.
-   **Deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Digital Ocean.
-   **Standards**: Indian Standard (IS) building codes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component that structures the application layout and routes. It was modified to incorporate the new UI enhancements, including header, footer, and routing for various pages.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx**: The header component of the application. It was enhanced to include navigation elements relevant to the new features, such as subscription and referral sections.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx**: The footer component. It was modified to ensure it aligns with the overall new UI/UX design.
-   **/app/frontend/src/context/PlanContext.tsx**: This file manages the application's state, specifically related to floor plans, subscriptions, and referral credits. It's crucial for managing the mock data and will be updated to handle real AI data and user-specific information. It was modified to support the new data models for material estimates, IS code compliance, and referral program state.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx**: The primary landing page where users input their floor plan requirements. It was significantly enhanced to offer both a Quick Description and an Advanced Form with detailed architectural fields, location input, and additional feature checkboxes.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/SubscriptionPage.tsx**: Displays the various subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise) and details. This page was updated to reflect the new pricing (₹999 Pro plan) and integrate the referral program UI, showing referral code generation, credit tracking, and sharing functionality.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ExportPage.tsx**: Where generated floor plans and related details (material estimates, IS code compliance) are displayed. It was enhanced with a tabbed interface to show Room Details, Material Estimates (bricks, cement, steel, sand, aggregate), and IS Code Check results.

All frontend changes utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and TypeScript for improved type safety.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Setup FastAPI, MongoDB integration, user management, and core API endpoints.
-   **AI Integration**: Implement DeepSeek API for floor plan generation, including prompt engineering for architectural accuracy and IS code compliance.
-   **Estimation Engines**: Develop algorithms for material (bricks, cement, steel, etc.) and excavation calculations.
-   **IS Code Validation**: Implement logic to check generated plans against Indian building standards.
-   **Payment Integration**: Set up Razorpay for subscription management and recurring payments.
-   **Referral System Backend**: Implement logic for referral code generation, credit tracking, and usage.
-   **Deployment Configuration**: Prepare deployment scripts and guides for cloud platforms (Digital Ocean, AWS, GCP).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the frontend enhancements, transforming the initial visual React website into a functional UI that incorporates the refined product requirements. This includes an advanced input form for detailed architectural specifications, updated subscription tiers (including the ₹999/month Pro plan), a fully integrated referral program UI with credit tracking, and an enhanced export page designed to display material estimates and IS code compliance. The frontend is currently running and has been validated via screenshots.

The immediate work stalled due to a user-reported inability to preview the frontend. The engineer attempted to diagnose and resolve this by checking running processes and restarting the frontend development server on port 3000. Following this, the user provided a new instruction, shifting the focus again.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to initiate the DeepSeek API integration as requested by the user, while ensuring the frontend remains accessible.
