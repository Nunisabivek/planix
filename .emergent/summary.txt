The previous AI engineer successfully transformed an initial React MVP into a production-ready full-stack application named Planix. Initially, the focus was on frontend enhancements, followed by a shift to backend development in Python (FastAPI). A pivotal user request then mandated a complete migration to JavaScript/TypeScript for both frontend and backend, along with a new nested directory structure ().

The engineer built out the JS/TS backend with user authentication, DeepSeek AI integration, and core application logic (floor plan generation, material/IS code estimation, subscriptions, referrals). Simultaneously, the frontend was adapted to consume these new APIs, incorporating advanced forms, a dashboard, and UI elements for authentication. Extensive troubleshooting was performed to resolve frontend preview issues (port conflicts, blank pages) and backend connectivity problems (MongoDB, server startup). The engineer successfully integrated the DeepSeek API, established a working local MongoDB setup, and prepared the entire codebase for cloud deployment (Vercel, Railway, MongoDB Atlas). The final key task addressed was fixing critical UI elements (login/register buttons, generate button alignment) and setting up robust production configurations. The current state leaves off right after the user provided the final MongoDB password to update the connection string.

The user required an AI-powered website, Planix, for floor plan and architectural generation. Key functionalities include generating plans from descriptions, adhering to Indian Standard (IS) codes, and providing material/excavation estimates. The initial technology stack was React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The business model features Free, Pro (price updated from ₹699 to ₹999, then ₹1,599/month), and Enterprise subscription tiers, along with a referral program. AI integration shifted from Gemini to DeepSeek API for cost-effectiveness. Razorpay was requested for payments. The user expressed a desire for cloud hosting (AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean, later explicitly Vercel/Railway for usage-based billing). A critical recent change was the explicit request to migrate the entire codebase (frontend and backend) to JavaScript/TypeScript for faster response times, and to organize it under a new  folder. The user emphasized a need for a production-ready, real-data website with full user authentication, a professional dashboard, and removal of all mock data.

<code_architecture>
The application now follows a nested full-stack structure under a new root directory .


*   ****: Contains the Node.js/Express.js backend.
    *   ****: The main entry point for the backend server, encompassing all API endpoints for user management, floor plan generation, subscriptions, and referrals. It was extensively modified during the migration from Python/FastAPI to Node.js/Express.js and handles DeepSeek API integration and MongoDB interactions.
    *   ****: A version of the server tailored for production, specifically configured to use the real MongoDB connection string.
    *   ****: A simplified backend server used for local testing, particularly when MongoDB connectivity issues arise, allowing the frontend to be tested independently.
    *   ****: Defines the Mongoose/MongoDB schemas for , , and  documents. Crucial for data persistence.
    *   ****: Handles the communication with the DeepSeek API for AI-powered floor plan generation.
    *   ****: Organizes API endpoints into modular files (e.g., , ).
    *   ** / **: Stores environment-specific variables like  and . Updated multiple times to reflect user-provided keys and the shift to production setup.
    *   ****: Configuration file for deploying the backend to Railway, specifying build and start commands.
*   ****: Contains the React.js/TypeScript frontend.
    *   ****: The main application component, now handling routing for authentication (Login, Register) and protected routes (Dashboard, Floor Plan Generation). It was significantly modified to integrate .
    *   ****: The header component, now includes Sign In and Get Started Free buttons for user authentication, and logic to show/hide them based on login status.
    *   ****: Modified to display a professional landing page for unauthenticated users and the floor plan generation form for authenticated users. The Generate button's alignment was also fixed.
    *   ****: A new file created to manage user authentication state (login, logout, user data) across the React application, using  for token persistence.
    *   ** /  / **: New pages implemented to handle user authentication and provide a post-login user dashboard.
    *   ****: Centralized API client for frontend-backend communication.
    *   ****: Updated to reflect the new Pro plan price of ₹1,599.
    *   ****: Configuration file for deploying the frontend to Vercel.
*   **Root Level Files (, , )**: Documentation and deployment configuration files for the entire Planix project, created to guide the user through cloud deployment.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved transforming the Planix application into a production-ready state with real data. This included:
1.  **Codebase Language Shift**: Completed the migration of the entire backend and frontend from Python/FastAPI to JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js/Express.js, respectively, and organized the project under .
2.  **User Authentication Implementation**: Added comprehensive user registration and login functionality, including new pages (, , ) and an  for state management.
3.  **UI/UX Fixes**: Corrected critical UI issues, specifically ensuring the Sign In and Get Started Free buttons appear correctly in  and fixing the misalignment of the Generate button on .  was also updated to differentiate content for authenticated versus unauthenticated users.
4.  **Pricing Update**: The Pro subscription plan price was updated to ₹1,599/month in .
5.  **Production Configuration**: Created dedicated production environment files (), database configuration (), and deployment configuration for Railway ().
6.  **Troubleshooting & Verification**: Addressed ongoing frontend preview issues (port conflicts between 3000 and 3001, blank pages) and backend server startup problems (initially due to missing MongoDB password). The engineer successfully got both the frontend and a test backend (without MongoDB) running to demonstrate the UI fixes.
The current status is that the application's UI/UX issues are fixed, authentication is integrated, and the system is deemed production-ready with the DeepSeek API configured for real data. The final step was to accept the actual MongoDB connection string from the user to fully enable the production backend with real data persistence.
