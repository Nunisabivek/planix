# Test Results - Planix AI Floor Plan Generator

## Original User Problem Statement
User requested an AI website for floor plan and architecture generation with:
- Core Functionality: Generate floor plans/architecture based on user descriptions
- Compliance: Adhere to Indian Standard (IS) codes and architectural ethics
- Estimation: Provide material and excavation estimations
- Technology Stack: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database
- Business Model: Subscription model with referral program
- AI Integration: DeepSeek API for cost-effectiveness
- Payment Gateway: Razorpay for Indian market

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Protocol
1. **MUST** use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent for all backend API testing
2. **MUST** read this file before invoking testing agents
3. **MUST** update this file with testing results after each test cycle
4. **ALWAYS** test backend first before frontend
5. **NEVER** use curl commands for testing - rely on testing agent

### Frontend Testing Protocol
1. **MUST** ask user permission before testing frontend using `ask_human` tool
2. **ONLY** use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` after user approval
3. **NEVER** invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission
4. **MUST** test backend thoroughly before frontend testing

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Provide clear, specific testing objectives
- Include relevant API endpoints and expected behaviors
- Specify authentication requirements if applicable
- Request comprehensive test coverage
- Always review test results before proceeding
